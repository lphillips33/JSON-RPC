Logan - 2 parsing methods

Nate - buildMessageForViewStore(), buildMessageForPurchase()

together - createHTTPMessage(), sendHTTPMessage().  We also helped each other on 
the above methods if we got stuck.

We also worked to develop a GUI in JavaFX, but we were running into small problems that we couldn't figure out.
This is unfortunate, because it was really quite the work of art.
